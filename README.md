## Bookshelf
Bookshelf is a web-based service for managing books. It allows users to create, update, delete, search and retrieve book records. It also contains an API which allows integration with other systems and enables development of apps for desktop and mobile clients.

The motivation behind bookshelf is to enable easy management, searching and retrieval of book information and replace manual paper based indexing systems. It is also the best option for managing a purely online library for Online Learning Institutions.

The Bookshelf API is written in Python and follows the PEP8 Guidelines *https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/*
